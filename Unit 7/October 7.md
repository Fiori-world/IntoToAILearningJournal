We learned how to run AI locally using Docker and Ollama, and how to create custom models with model files that control AI behavior. 
In class, we built a Svelte project for the Iowa Tech Summit website, using AI to generate code, then testing and refining it. Key practices 
included making reusable components, using props, and refactoring for modular code. We discussed best practices: understand AI output, test frequently, refine prompts, and use version control. 
AI can produce outdated or incorrect code if not guided properly, so knowing the basics helps.
