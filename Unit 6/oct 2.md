Today we learned about the dot-com bubble from the 1990s when “.com” companies were overvalued and crashed. The AI bubble today is much larger but may slowly decrease instead of popping. Real profit comes from companies running the models, like AWS and Azure.

For Unit 6, the project is due Tuesday. We need to take a screenshot of a local model running, build our own model file, and connect the front end with Olama using npm install olama. Make sure the port number matches the Docker container’s port.

Unit 7 will focus on AI-driven development using Svelte, a modern web framework. Svelte compiles code into plain JavaScript, making apps faster and smaller. To set up, install Node.js, then create a project with npx sv create project-name, install dependencies, and run npm run dev.

Svelte uses .svelte files that mix HTML, CSS, and JS. We can make reusable components like headers and add interactivity with simple scripts and events. The goal is to understand the basics so we can use AI tools to help write code.
