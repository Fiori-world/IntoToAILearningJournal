We just worked on our group project we talked about what we're doing and just different outputs and trying to figure out what we want versus what we don't want We looked over the requirements since I wasn't there for the last time I was just trying to figure out what they chose and then we changed it honestly We picked different things first they did the model file and Olama And there was one more thing they did but we changed it now we're doing the contact creation AI and one more thing but honestly what I really really wanted was the contact creation using AI and then hosting it I feel like that would be so good but yeah
