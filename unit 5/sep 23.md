started with a short talk about NASA finding possible signs of past life, called biosignatures, on Mars. Then it moved to the main topic virtualization. Virtualization means making a fake computer inside your real one, called a virtual machine (VM). It lets you run different operating systems on the same computer safely. A hypervisor is the software that runs these virtual machines. There are two types: Type 1 runs directly on hardware, and Type 2 runs inside your regular computer system (we use VirtualBox, which is Type 2). In class, we learned how to install Debian Linux in VirtualBox by creating a new VM, choosing settings like RAM and storage, and using an ISO file to install the system. This helps us practice using Linux without changing our real computer.
