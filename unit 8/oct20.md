Today’s lecture was about Full Stack Development and a tool called N8N. The teacher talked about how people, even in the Army, use ChatGPT for work which i think is very crazy . The final project will be a group project worth around 30–40 points, and there will be no final test. Full stack means working with the frontend, backend, and database of a system. N8N is a free tool that helps automate tasks without needing to code. It can connect apps like Google Sheets or ChatGPT and save lots of time. The main idea was that automation makes work easier, but people still need to check the results.
