for  the group project I added dark mode and light mode, plus two extra functions that weren’t on the original feature list. I’m feeling confused because I’m not sure if that’s okay or how it affects the rest of the project, especially with how Olama is supposed to link or interact with the features we added.i am not not sure if i am to follow original list strictly or if custom additions are allowed i am still trying to figure out how to link olama docker wasnt really working for me idk why 
today is also the last day to work on it we are switching tommorow so i am just trying get it to somehow work hopefully
