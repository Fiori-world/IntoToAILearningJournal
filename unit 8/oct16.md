Today, we switched projects with another group and worked on them the whole class. My partner and I decided to try doing our own project first. Mine works, but it had a small problem with linking, so we went with her version the one we gave to the other group since it worked. Mine is still good though so  Iâ€™ll probably work on it later to figure out how to link it correctly without errors.
