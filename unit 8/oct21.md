Today’s lecture talked about the AI bubble and how big companies like NVIDIA, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Oracle are trading huge amounts of money with each other. NVIDIA designs chips for AI but doesn’t actually make them After that, we worked on a hands on activity using N8N, Docker, and MySQL. i learning how to download and run a database, then import it into N8N to make a simple workflow that turns a database into an Excel spreadsheet. i am not really there yet but i will just watch the lecture from today and follow through.




 The final task was to screenshot the successful workflow and turn in the Excel file as proof.
